# Real-Geek-for-myself
Standards for myself to be a real geek.

***Focus***

*I am not the person who do something very quickly and I say,"Yeah,it's done.I just won't let go."I explore more about that and I quite enjoy it.*

*Real geek codes for fun,like jarvis,hhh,And also code for sense.*

*When talking about technology,You can see the happiness in their eyes.*


***Taste***

*Quit special case.For normal ones.*
